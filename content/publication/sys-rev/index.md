abstract: Stroke is a life-threatening medical condition that could lead to mortality or significant sensorimotor deficits. Various machine learning techniques have been successfully used to detect and predict stroke-related outcomes. Considering the diversity in the type of clinical modalities involved during management of patients with stroke, such as medical images, bio-signals, and clinical data, multimodal machine learning has become increasingly popular. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature review to understand the current status of state-of-the-art multimodal machine learning methods for stroke prognosis and diagnosis. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines during literature search and selection, our results show that the most dominant techniques are related to the fusion paradigm, specifically early, joint and late fusion. We discuss opportunities to leverage other multimodal learning paradigms, such as multimodal translation and alignment, which are generally less explored. We also discuss the scale of datasets and types of modalities used to develop existing models, highlighting opportunities for the creation of more diverse multimodal datasets. Finally, we present ongoing challenges and provide a set of recommendations to drive the next generation of multimodal learning methods for improved prognosis and diagnosis of patients with stroke.
